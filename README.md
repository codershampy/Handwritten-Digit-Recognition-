# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
A Handwritten Digit Recognition model is a machine learning designed to automatically identify and classify handwritten digits (0 through 9) from image inputs.It is a supervised learning model that processes input images (typically 28x28 grayscale pixels) and outputs a predicted class label (0â€“9), using features extracted from the image to learn patterns associated with each digit class.

Objective: To train a machine learning (or deep learning) model to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

ðŸ“š Dataset Used
MNIST Dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology):
-60,000 training images
-10,000 test images
-Each image: 28x28 grayscale
-Labels: digits from 0 to 9
